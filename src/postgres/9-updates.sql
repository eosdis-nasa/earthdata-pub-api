-- Create table if not exists:

--     ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE (unique_column_one, unique_column_two);
-- Add foreign key constraint:
--     ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT foreign_key_name FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES table_name (column_name);
-- Update db content
--     UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'value' WHERE condition;
